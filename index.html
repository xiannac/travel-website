            <h2>Switzerland the land of chocolate and cheese</h2>
            <p>
              There are things that represent a country to the rest of the world
              like no other – and when it comes to Switzerland, if you look
              beyond the alpine ranges, glaciers, ski slopes and lakes, it’s the
              little things that loom large. Little things like chocolate, or
              the national dish of fondue – the fish and chips of the ski-loving
              set. There’s precision watchmaking, too, the results of which sit
              in the windows of the world’s most exclusive jewellers. Then there
              are the seasonal festivals such as Basel’s spectacular Fasnacht,
              the biggest festival in Switzerland, held each year as the last
              hurrah before the fasting period begins after Ash Wednesday.

              Hi! My name is Xianna and I've always found Switzerland amazing
              and wanted to share how beautiful this place is. I created this
              page as part of a project for SheCodes Responsive to develop my
              coding skills.
